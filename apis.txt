GET /accounts/${base64_name}/pw/${hash}
  - if the account exists with that password, return the account data
GET /accounts/${base64_name}
  - if any account exists with that name, return true
POST /accounts
  - given an account and password (hash) create the account if it doesn't exist
PUT /accounts/${base64_name}/pw/${hash}
  - update the account indicated by the account and password
PUT /accounts/${base64_name}/verify
  - update the account to show that email has been verified (requires a code sent in email)
  - verify code is sent in body
PUT /accounts/${base64_name}/reset/${code}
  - update the account to reset the password (requires a code sent in email)
  - new password hash is sent in body
  - reset code is sent in body

Notes:
1) verify and reset will require more  complicated caller code than just proxying the 
   URL from the caller domain through to sideauth
2) I'll probably discover additional requirements when I implement a user of sideauth
