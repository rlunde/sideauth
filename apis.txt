GET /accounts/${base64_name}/pw/${hash}
  - if the account exists with that password, return the account data
GET /accounts/${base64_name}
  - if any account exists with that name, return true
POST /accounts
  - given an account and password (hash) create the account if it doesn't exist
PUT /accounts/${base64_name}/pw/${hash}
  - update the account indicated by the account and password
PUT /accounts/${base64_name}/verify/${code}
  - update the account to show that email has been verified (requires a code sent in email)
  - verify code is sent in URL so it can be a simple link
PUT /accounts/${base64_name}/reset
  - update the account to reset the password (requires a code sent in email)
  - new password hash is sent in body
  - reset code is sent in body

Notes:
1) verify and reset will require more  complicated caller code than just proxying the 
   URL from the caller domain through to sideauth
2) I'll probably discover additional requirements when I implement a user of sideauth
3) To create an account:
  a) use POST accounts, which succeeds unless the account already exists
  b) sideauth sends email to user's address: send failure causes failure to change status to verified
  c) email contains a link to click
  d) clicked link updates the account to mark it verified
4) To reset a password, it's similar to verifying email in the first place
  a) user clicks on a reset link provided by app server
  b) app server uses PUT /accounts/${base64_name}/reset with a secret code
  c) if account exists, mark it unverified
  d) the app will send an email link to web page in app domain
  e) the reset page will get a code from the link, let user choose new password, and POST the results
  f) use the same PUT /accounts/${base64_name}/verify/${code} except with email sent in body

I wish I could think of a simple solution that didn't involve handling APIs / pages from the user
directly. Maybe those pages should be proxied through the app? I need to think about it some more.

Also need to think about threat model and security issues. For example, how do I stop someone
from creating millions of unverified accounts? How do I stop someone from using this service to 
SPAM someone else's email with thousands of "verify your account" emails?
