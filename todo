[x] finish going through https://golang.org/doc/code.html
[x] replace gin with standard net/http and gorilla
[ ] refactor stuff brought in from funtodone into apis from api.txt -- try doing them in this order:
  [ ] POST /accounts
  [ ] GET /accounts/${base64_name}/pw/${hash}
  [ ] GET /accounts/${base64_name}
  [ ] POST /sessions
  [ ] PUT /sessions/${id}

[ ] sideauth should keep track of which sessions are valid by UUID
[ ] the caller should hash the password with salt sideauth never sees
[ ] a session should be tied to an account and email
[ ] read up on how OAuth2 works
[ ] session data should be managed by sideauth
