[ ] refactor stuff brought in from funtodone into apis from api.txt -- try doing them in this order:
  [ ] POST /accounts -- create an account
  [ ] GET /accounts/${base64_name}/pw/${hash} -- verify that this account has this password hash
  [ ] GET /accounts/${base64_name} -- check if an account exists
  [ ] PUT /accounts/${base64_name} -- reset a password, update an email
[ ] write tests for apis
  [ ] /sideauth/v1/status
