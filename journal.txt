I think I'll try keeping a little journal of my adventures making this, that may
help me make a blog entry or two after I get sideauth working (at least minimally).

I'm still trying to clean up the code I extracted into the sideauth project from
funtodone, and rename things, reorganize things, etc. Fortunately, since this is
no longer just a bit of another project, I can take my time with this and use TDD,
and see what kind of best practices I can learn while doing it.

The first thing I'm working on is a POST to create a new account. I want to eventually
add support for OAuth2, but for now I just want to get regular accounts with passwords
implemented, with password reset done via email and account creation verified by 
email. I'll need to add APIs for reset and account verification.

I've got some code in session_persist.go that should be helpful in figuring out the
account stuff for mongo interactions.
